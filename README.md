# Microsoft-Azure-Detection

My Microsoft Azure Detection Project involves deploying, configuring, and integrating a variety of Azure tools and services (like Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, and Azure Security Center) to continuously monitor your cloud environment for suspicious activity and potential security threats. Effective detection mechanisms allow organizations to quickly identify and respond to incidents, minimizing the impact of cyberattacks and ensuring a secure Azure environment.

 Theses are the Steps taken in this project:


1.Set Up Azure Security Center (ASC):
Enable Azure Security Center to continuously monitor your Azure resources and provide recommendations for improving your security posture.
Review security alerts from ASC, focusing on critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

2.Deploy Azure Sentinel for Advanced Detection:
Enable Azure Sentinel as your cloud-native SIEM to aggregate logs from Azure resources and other services (e.g., AWS, on-prem).
Set up pre-built data connectors for Azure resources like Azure Active Directory, Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and third-party tools.
Customize detection rules based on your specific environment to catch suspicious activities and potential breaches.
Use Machine Learning in Sentinel to detect unusual behaviors, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

3.Configure Azure Monitor for Log Collection:
Set up Azure Monitor to collect logs from key Azure services (e.g., Virtual Machines, App Services, SQL databases) for analysis.
Enable Log Analytics to query and analyze logs for potential threats.
Ensure all logs are forwarded to Azure Sentinel for centralized detection and alerting.

4.Configure Network Security (Azure Firewall, NSGs):
Ensure Azure Firewall is in place to monitor traffic to and from your network.
Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control and monitor inbound and outbound traffic.
Review traffic logs to detect any signs of malicious activity, such as unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

5.Enable Identity Protection (Microsoft Defender for Identity):
Set up Microsoft Defender for Identity to monitor Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and detect suspicious identity activities, such as brute-force attempts, compromised credentials, and lateral movement.
Review identity-based alerts for signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

6.Monitor DDoS Attacks with Azure DDoS Protection:
Enable Azure DDoS Protection to protect your Azure infrastructure from large-scale attacks.
Monitor DDoS attack reports and ensure automatic mitigation is in place to prevent service disruptions.

7.Set Up Incident Response and Case Management:
Use Azure Sentinelâ€™s case management features to track and manage security incidents detected by Azure services.
Establish procedures for investigating alerts, responding to potential threats, and escalating incidents as needed.

8.Continuous Improvement:
I then Regularly review security alerts, detection rules, and configurations to ensure that your Azure environment is effectively protected.
Conduct periodic red team assessments to test detection capabilities and identify any gaps.
